<p>Classics presented by Rooftop Cinema Club in association with Dow Jones, for Dow Jones employees only and I was lucky to attend. I guess back in 1985 Sci-Fi films are much simpler. Not a fan of the mix of Sci-Fi and comedy but the rooftop movie experience was nice.</p>

It&rsquo;s interesting to see the monastery life of Buddhist monks and nuns, but enlightenment didn&rsquo;t happen to me today. Maybe next time.</p>

<p>First of all, how could this be a &ldquo;Sci-Fi&rdquo; film and be called &ldquo;Stalker&rdquo;? It is more accurate to be a poetry and named &ldquo;Smuggler&rdquo;. Considering it was made in the Soviet Union, I can see some of the monologues&rsquo; meanings. Great visual, music and sound effects. It&rsquo;s apocalyptic, will leave you wondering for days.</p>

<p>Probably the best movie of the year. This movie did everything right. Characters were very convincing. Excellent use of action and aerial shots and music. I&rsquo;d willing to see it again next week.</p>

<p>This movie has the potential to be so much better but didn&rsquo;t. John Cho was a charming in the movie and I&rsquo;d fall in love with him. Everything else sucks. Too slow, too boring, waste of time. The main actress was horrible. I know what it feels like to be a young girl having a crush on an older man, having been such a girl myself for years, and I can surely do a better job than her. I probably checked my phone for the most times during this movie than every other because it&rsquo;s just too boring. Too bad because the story is actually interesting. The movie is more than 2 hours long, could trim to 1.5 hours and be a much better story.</p>

<p>Also called &ldquo;From the Land of the Moon&rdquo; in English. Melodrama. Good story and imagination. Marion Cotillard&rsquo;s performance is great as usual.</p>

<p>Pioneer Lesbian movie. Worth seeing if you are into the genre. The sex scene is a little too long and too revealing, maybe not good for a theater.</p>

<p>Very typical Luc Besson movie with great imagination and shots. The story is weak but still enjoyable. With the special effects, it is very entertaining.</p>

<p>The book was great but the movie was disappointing. Even Rachel Weisz didn&rsquo;t save it. The story jumps too quickly from one scene to another, and I believe people who didn&rsquo;t read the book couldn&rsquo;t really understand it.</p>

<p>Based on a true story, could be better. The title is confusing, it should be something suggesting that this is a story about a man&rsquo;s quest for a lost world instead of a journey through an unknown culture/territory.</p>

<p>It seems like the producer picked actors first then found some random person to write the plot; if you can call that a plot. Hence there is no coherent story. It is a complete waste of time and money. Vin Diesel is a cool guy and I enjoy seeing his updates on Facebook Live, but these types of movies watching the trailer is enough.</p>

<p>Poster Design is great. Even though the movie had a star Mark Wahlberg, it did not turn into a one man hero narrative, instead, every character is well presented and has a distinctive personality. Also excellent use of actual footage and interviews of survivors in the end. It&rsquo;s an inspiration whether or not you run marathons.</p>
