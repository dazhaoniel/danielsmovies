      <description>Classics presented by Rooftop Cinema Club in association with Dow Jones, for Dow Jones employees only and I was lucky to attend. I guess back in 1985 Sci-Fi films are much simpler. Not a fan of the mix of Sci-Fi and comedy but the rooftop movie experience was nice.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s interesting to see the monastery life of Buddhist monks and nuns, but enlightenment didn&amp;rsquo;t happen to me today. Maybe next time.</description>

      <description>First of all, how could this be a &amp;ldquo;Sci-Fi&amp;rdquo; film and be called &amp;ldquo;Stalker&amp;rdquo;? It is more accurate to be a poetry and named &amp;ldquo;Smuggler&amp;rdquo;. Considering it was made in the Soviet Union, I can see some of the monologues&amp;rsquo; meanings. Great visual, music and sound effects. It&amp;rsquo;s apocalyptic, will leave you wondering for days.</description>

      <description>Probably the best movie of the year. This movie did everything right. Characters were very convincing. Excellent use of action and aerial shots and music. I&amp;rsquo;d willing to see it again next week.</description>

      <description>This movie has the potential to be so much better but didn&amp;rsquo;t. John Cho was a charming in the movie and I&amp;rsquo;d fall in love with him. Everything else sucks. Too slow, too boring, waste of time. The main actress was horrible. I know what it feels like to be a young girl having a crush on an older man, having been such a girl myself for years, and I can surely do a better job than her.</description>

      <description>Also called &amp;ldquo;From the Land of the Moon&amp;rdquo; in English. Melodrama. Good story and imagination. Marion Cotillard&amp;rsquo;s performance is great as usual.</description>

      <description>Pioneer Lesbian movie. Worth seeing if you are into the genre. The sex scene is a little too long and too revealing, maybe not good for a theater.</description>

      <description>Very typical Luc Besson movie with great imagination and shots. The story is weak but still enjoyable. With the special effects, it is very entertaining.</description>

      <description>I was disappointed probably because my hope was too high. Still a great movie, just not the best one of the year. Excellent usage of sound effects and analogue camera.</description>

      <description>Femme Fatale type of protagonist. Great plot and adaptation of the original novel. I like how she got away with three murders in the end. It&amp;rsquo;s refreshing.</description>

      <description>Horrible. The story is too slow and I almost fell asleep. My date actually fell asleep, and he had seen the previous two.</description>

      <description>The book was great but the movie was disappointing. Even Rachel Weisz didn&amp;rsquo;t save it. The story jumps too quickly from one scene to another, and I believe people who didn&amp;rsquo;t read the book couldn&amp;rsquo;t really understand it.</description>

      <description>Probably (and hopefully) the worst Tom Cruise movie ever. Please, no more instalment of the mummy!</description>

      <description>Good story and special effects, it has all the elements to be a good Sci-Fi/Horror movie and be entertaining.</description>

      <description>Super funny though the story is a little predictable that the dad is the villain. I would still want to see Vol. 3.</description>

      <description>Not as bad as I thought, but still I can do without seeing it. Emma Watson should just be a public figure and UN Ambassador and stop acting.</description>

      <description>A heavy topic like the Armenian Genocide should be based some better story than a love triangle and the woman eventually dies. It&amp;rsquo;s just too Hollywood. Disappointing.</description>

      <description>Based on a true story, could be better. The title is confusing, it should be something suggesting that this is a story about a man&amp;rsquo;s quest for a lost world instead of a journey through an unknown culture/territory.</description>

      <description>A weird story indicating humanity was destroyed in the end. Most of the Sci-Fi movies are not as depressing as this one and for this reason, I like this one better.</description>

      <description>My first X-Men movie of any series and probably the last one since Logan dies in the end. It&amp;rsquo;s a good story well told.</description>

      <description>Funny and creative. Too many people already talked too much about it so I won&amp;rsquo;t repeat.</description>

      <description>The story is weird, also meaning creative. Probably one of the best movies of the year. Music is really good.</description>

      <description>It seems like the producer picked actors first then found some random person to write the plot; if you can call that a plot. Hence there is no coherent story. It is a complete waste of time and money. Vin Diesel is a cool guy and I enjoy seeing his updates on Facebook Live, but these types of movies watching the trailer is enough.</description>

      <description>Too long. The narrators at the beginning and the end are different so it was a little confusing. The filming location of rural Japan is amazingly beautiful though.</description>

      <description>Poster Design is great. Even though the movie had a star Mark Wahlberg, it did not turn into a one man hero narrative, instead, every character is well presented and has a distinctive personality. Also excellent use of actual footage and interviews of survivors in the end. It&amp;rsquo;s an inspiration whether or not you run marathons.</description>
