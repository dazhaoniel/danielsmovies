# Daniel's Movie Reviews of 2017

I decided to learn a little about static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). I know there's a more popular one [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) but I decided to use Hugo because a friend recommended it to me for its independent on any programming language runtime and its live reloading of the content. I made this movie reviews website based on Hugo about all the movies I watched in 2017.
