It seems like the producer picked actors first then found some random person to write the plot; if you can call that a plot. Hence there is no coherent story. It is a complete waste of time and money. Vin Diesel is a cool guy and I enjoy seeing his updates on Facebook Live, but these types of movies watching the trailer is enough.
