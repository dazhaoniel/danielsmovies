First of all, how could this be a "Sci-Fi" film and be called "Stalker"? It is more accurate to be a poetry and named "Smuggler". Considering it was made in the Soviet Union, I can see some of the monologues' meanings. Great visual, music and sound effects. It's apocalyptic, will leave you wondering for days.
