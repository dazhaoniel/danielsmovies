This movie has the potential to be so much better but didn't. John Cho was a charming in the movie and I'd fall in love with him. Everything else sucks. Too slow, too boring, waste of time. The main actress was horrible. I know what it feels like to be a young girl having a crush on an older man, having been such a girl myself for years, and I can surely do a better job than her. I probably checked my phone for the most times during this movie than every other because it's just too boring. Too bad because the story is actually interesting. The movie is more than 2 hours long, could trim to 1.5 hours and be a much better story.
