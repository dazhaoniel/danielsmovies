Poster Design is great. Even though the movie had a star Mark Wahlberg, it did not turn into a one man hero narrative, instead, every character is well presented and has a distinctive personality. Also excellent use of actual footage and interviews of survivors in the end. It's an inspiration whether or not you run marathons.
